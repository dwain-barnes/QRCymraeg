## What is QRishing?

QRishing is a type of phishing attack that uses QR codes to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware onto their devices. Attackers create malicious QR codes and distribute them through various channels, such as email, social media, or printed materials. When victims scan these codes, they are directed to fake websites that look legitimate and are prompted to enter their credentials or download malware.

## Protect Yourself

- **Be Cautious**: Avoid scanning QR codes from untrusted sources.
- **Verify URLs**: Double-check the URL if a scanned code directs you to a website asking for sensitive information.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep your device's operating system and security software up to date to protect against malware.
